# ECHO V1.5

The Python version of ECHO is no longer being worked on. Please use https://github.com/will-scargill/echov2

Readme coming soon. THIS IS NOT FINISHED, there's still a few bugs and a couple of things I still want to add. A couple of significant things regarding disconnecting from servers and adding and deleting servers in the settings.
